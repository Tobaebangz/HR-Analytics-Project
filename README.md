# HR Analytics Project
This is a dataset of different roles in different departments of a company. The company has over 1,470 employees.
The HR is assigned with the task of employees. The employer wants to know the number of employees who have left the company. To do so, we will calculate the attrition, attrition rate, the total number of active employees.
To get the attrition, we will divide the number of employees that left by the total number of total employees at the beginning of a specific period.
I visualized this project using Power BI. 
This dashboard can quickly review and analyze all critical KPIs in one place. It helps HR teams to understand the satisfaction rate, number of employees based on age group, gender wise attrition rate
